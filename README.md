## It's a movie collector! It's a game! It's a trip down the rabbit hole of horrible movies!

Netflix, Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes. They all try to point us in the direction of quality cinema that is worth your hard-earned dollars and time. But what aren't they showing you? Yeah, I ranked that sci-fi B movie "2 Stars", but that dosen't mean I don't want to see movies like that on my feed!
Gross, I Love It! To the rescue!
A fun, movie-collection app that only allows the worst of the worst from the archives over at The MoiveDB!
